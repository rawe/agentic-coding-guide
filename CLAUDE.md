# CLAUDE.md

Knowledge base for agentic coding best practices. Currently in material collection phase.

## Writing Rules

- No filler. No AI slop. Every sentence must carry information.
- Write for a human who wants to learn fast.
- Summaries: bullet points over paragraphs. Facts over commentary.
- Guides (later phase): more prose is acceptable, but still no fluff.
- Always cite the original source with URL and author.

## Project Structure

- `sources/` — collected references. See [sources/README.md](sources/README.md) for structure, templates, and workflow.
- `guides/` — distilled best practices (phase 2).
- `.claude/skills/` — processing skills (e.g. `/yt-extract <url>`).

## Commit Rules

- Never mention AI, co-authors, Claude, or any coding model in commit messages.
- No `Co-Authored-By` lines.
- Write commits as if a human wrote them. Short, descriptive, conventional.
