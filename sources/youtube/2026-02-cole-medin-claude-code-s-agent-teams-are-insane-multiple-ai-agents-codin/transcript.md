[0:00] Take a look at this. I have four
[0:02] instances of Claude code working at the
[0:05] exact same time together to perform a
[0:07] code review on my codebase. And this is
[0:10] all thanks to the new agents teams
[0:12] feature that Enthropic has built into
[0:14] cloud code. And man, let me tell you, it
[0:17] really does look like I'm peering into
[0:19] the future of agentic engineering when I
[0:21] am using it. So, we have our primary
[0:24] lead agent on the lefth hand side. And
[0:26] in real time, I watched it spin up each
[0:28] one of these T-Mux terminals to create
[0:31] these agents to collaborate on the same
[0:33] task. Now, people have been doing this
[0:35] sort of split pane multi-teux terminal
[0:38] sort of setup for a while now. So, it's
[0:41] not really new, but there are a couple
[0:43] of things that make this super novel.
[0:46] The first is that our primary agent, it
[0:49] actually decided the team to form based
[0:52] on the request that I gave it. And the
[0:54] other part of this that makes it so
[0:55] powerful is that under the hood, each
[0:57] one of these agents is working on the
[0:59] exact same task list together. So this
[1:02] goes way beyond sub agents. These agents
[1:05] actually talk to each other like, "Oh,
[1:06] let me complete this before you work on
[1:08] this." They have that kind of
[1:09] communication that makes it so that we
[1:11] can take this idea of parallel agents a
[1:13] lot further. So in this video, I want to
[1:16] cover how agent teams works with you.
[1:18] It's a new experimental feature that you
[1:20] have to enable. We'll talk about how to
[1:22] set it up. I also really want to cover
[1:24] how agent teams is different from sub
[1:27] aents. A lot of people are confused by
[1:29] this right now because they operate
[1:31] really similarly. The main difference is
[1:33] we have collaboration versus isolation.
[1:36] There are pros and cons here that I want
[1:37] to cover. Agent teams is really powerful
[1:40] but it is not perfect. So we'll get into
[1:42] that which will also lead into a
[1:44] template that I have for you. This is a
[1:46] command that I've built. Basically, you
[1:48] can use this to give instructions for
[1:50] cloud code on to how to use agent teams
[1:53] better because believe it or not, even
[1:55] though this is a feature built into
[1:56] cloud code, it's not actually that good
[1:58] at using it. And so, I'll show you how
[2:00] to really take advantage of this new
[2:02] feature to do some pretty incredible
[2:04] things. Now, this code review
[2:06] demonstration that I have for you is
[2:08] just a really simple example what we can
[2:10] do with agent teams. Anthropic has
[2:13] published a couple of articles where
[2:14] they've shown how far we can push this
[2:17] idea. For example, Anthropic used 16
[2:20] agents running together with this new
[2:22] agent teams feature to build an entire C
[2:25] compiler. And let me tell you, building
[2:27] a compiler from scratch is not easy. If
[2:30] you were to hire a dev team to do this,
[2:32] it would probably be hundreds of
[2:33] thousands of dollars. But they were able
[2:35] to do it with only $20,000 in API costs,
[2:38] which yes, that is still an insane
[2:40] amount of money. agent teams is very
[2:43] tokenheavy, which is one of the
[2:44] downsides we'll talk about in a little
[2:46] bit. But it's still really cool to see
[2:48] how far they were able to push what is
[2:50] possible with coding agents just running
[2:52] together, collaborating autonomously.
[2:54] They literally just threw this in
[2:56] essentially a RA loop where they forced
[2:58] it to write, I believe, hundreds of
[3:00] thousands of lines of code to create
[3:01] this. So, it's very, very incredible.
[3:04] the kind of thing that they say later in
[3:05] this article, there's no way that a
[3:07] single agent would have been able to do
[3:09] even if you were to give this whole task
[3:11] to, you know, Opus 4.6, for example. All
[3:14] right, so really quickly, I want to show
[3:15] you how you can get your first agent
[3:17] team up and running in just a couple of
[3:19] minutes, and then we'll get into how
[3:21] it's different from sub agents because
[3:23] it is really important to understand.
[3:25] So, I will have a link to this page in
[3:28] the description. This is the official
[3:29] guide on agent teams from Anthropic.
[3:32] However, there is a lot of information
[3:34] here. It's pretty overwhelming and so I
[3:36] just want to break it down nice and
[3:37] simple for you right now. So, the first
[3:39] thing you have to do because this is an
[3:41] experimental feature that is far from
[3:43] perfect, trust me, you have to enable
[3:45] it. And so, you can either set this
[3:47] environment variable on your computer or
[3:49] in just a terminal session or you can
[3:52] add this to your settings.json. So, this
[3:54] is one of the config files for cloud
[3:56] code. You've probably worked with this
[3:58] before because it's where you set things
[3:59] like your MCP servers and your hooks.
[4:01] And so we can set this at either the
[4:03] global.cloud level or in the docloud
[4:06] project directory. And so you can enable
[4:09] agent teams just for specific projects
[4:11] if you want. So the other thing that you
[4:13] have to set up if you want that split
[4:15] pane mode where you can see all the
[4:17] terminals at the exact same time is you
[4:19] need to install either T-Mox or iTerm 2.
[4:22] These are terminal applications that
[4:24] support the split pane mode and these
[4:25] are just the two that are supported by
[4:27] claude code right now. So if you install
[4:29] T-Mox which is my recommendation or
[4:31] iTerm 2 then claude code can leverage
[4:34] that directly to create those terminals
[4:36] and you can watch them appear in real
[4:38] time. We'll see that in a second. It is
[4:39] really really cool. And so the
[4:41] instructions is a bit different
[4:42] depending on your operating system. But
[4:45] actually in the agent team skill
[4:47] resource that I have for you I have a
[4:48] readme that gives you the installation
[4:50] instructions. So really really easy.
[4:52] Just keep in mind for Windows you do
[4:54] need WSL. And so I actually have that.
[4:57] So I got my Linux subsystem here on
[4:58] Windows. I'm running on Windows right
[5:00] now. And so the first thing you have to
[5:02] do is you have to set that environment
[5:04] variable. So either like this or in that
[5:06] settings.json file. So cloud code
[5:08] experimental agent teams. Boom. There we
[5:10] go. And so now the next time I go into
[5:12] claude agent teams is available to me.
[5:15] So now, just like with sub agents, all
[5:17] we have to do is tell Claude we want to
[5:19] use the agent team feature, and it's
[5:21] going to know exactly what we mean. And
[5:23] so for a very simple example, I'm going
[5:26] to send in this request right here. So
[5:28] I'm asking it to create an agent team to
[5:30] review my codebase. Similar to the demo
[5:32] I showed you earlier, that was a lot
[5:33] longer of a prompt, though. But for
[5:35] simplicity, I'm just going to say have
[5:36] one agent focus on security, one on code
[5:39] quality, and the other on documentation.
[5:41] Now, we could use sub agents for this as
[5:44] well, but the collaboration we have
[5:46] here, even for a simple example like
[5:48] this, I think is really powerful
[5:50] because, for example, the review on
[5:51] security might affect the way that we
[5:53] see documentation. Like maybe we need to
[5:55] make sure we document any potential
[5:57] security issues that exist in the
[5:59] codebase. I think you get the idea of
[6:00] how that collaboration even for a
[6:02] review, but especially for when we're
[6:04] diving into actually writing code, that
[6:06] is really, really necessary. And so the
[6:09] lead agent here, it's going to do its
[6:12] initial analysis, think about the team
[6:14] to generate, and then it'll spin those
[6:16] off. So I'll pause and come back once
[6:18] we've gotten to that point. So here we
[6:20] go. Usually the indicator is something
[6:21] like, let me create the tasks and spawn
[6:24] all three review agents because it
[6:26] defines the task list that is shared
[6:28] between all the agents once they
[6:30] collaborate. And then in just a second
[6:32] here, we'll see the first pane spin up
[6:34] on the right hand side. And then it'll
[6:36] do all three one by one. And boom, there
[6:39] we go. We have our security reviewer to
[6:42] start. And you can see the command that
[6:44] the lead agent runs. It's just starting
[6:46] another cloud code session, but it's
[6:48] passing in the prompt to give it that
[6:49] context around its role. It is the
[6:52] security reviewer. And then giving it
[6:53] the task list and access to manage that
[6:55] with the other agents. And yeah, a lot
[6:57] is happening here. a lot of buzz on my
[6:59] screen but it has started all three
[7:00] agents now really really quickly and
[7:03] each one of them is focused on their
[7:04] individual task but they'll start
[7:06] communicating with each other. Now one
[7:08] thing that I will say is you have to
[7:10] watch the logs very very closely just to
[7:13] get a sense for when the agents are
[7:16] actually talking to each other. So maybe
[7:18] that's one of the gripes that I have
[7:19] with agent teams right now is there's
[7:20] really not that much visibility into the
[7:23] actual collaboration. And so I have seen
[7:26] examples as I've been testing things.
[7:28] And if you ask the lead agent after how
[7:30] the agents collaborated, it will give
[7:32] you a good answer, but for a lot of it,
[7:34] I just feel like I'm trusting that the
[7:36] agents really are working on the task
[7:38] list together. There's not a really good
[7:39] way to dive into it. Now, one thing you
[7:42] can do is you can press CtrlB and then
[7:45] you can press an arrow key to navigate
[7:48] between the different T-Mox terminals.
[7:49] And so I can chat with any one of the
[7:51] agents here to ask it like what are you
[7:53] currently working on? How are you
[7:54] collaborating with this agent? It's also
[7:56] really powerful to go to the primary
[7:58] agent ask that as well. It give me a
[8:00] status update on the task list and what
[8:02] the agents are working on. And then by
[8:04] the way once all of the agents in the
[8:06] team are done the lead agent will spin
[8:08] down all those terminals and you're
[8:09] brought back to the simple view here
[8:11] where you can continue to work with the
[8:12] primary cloud code agent or spin up
[8:14] another team if you want. So, I want to
[8:17] take a little bit of a different break
[8:18] from the video than I usually do. I'm
[8:21] speaking at an event this March, which I
[8:22] am super excited to tell you about. It
[8:24] is the Sonar Summit, which is Sonar's
[8:27] first ever global virtual event. And I'm
[8:29] doing a fireside chat on building self-
[8:32] validation and guardrails into AI coding
[8:34] systems. And this has been a big focus
[8:36] of mine because here's the thing, AI is
[8:39] already writing 30 to 40% of new code at
[8:42] major tech companies. So, adoption is
[8:44] pretty much universal. But teams are
[8:46] realizing that shipping code faster does
[8:49] not necessarily mean also shipping
[8:51] quality faster. Review times are
[8:53] climbing, incidents are up, and security
[8:55] vulnerabilities just slip through. So
[8:57] for my session, I'll be covering what I
[8:59] call the AI validation pyramid. This is
[9:02] a framework that allows us to define the
[9:04] validation requirements before we even
[9:06] write a single line of code. So it's a
[9:08] part of our plan. And we have our agent
[9:10] handle the foundation, all the easy
[9:12] things like the type checking and
[9:14] linting and our initial round of
[9:16] testing. And then we as the humans
[9:17] control the layers that matter most. And
[9:20] besides my event, there is a lot more
[9:22] going on at the Sonar Summit. There are
[9:24] four tracks in total with keynotes on
[9:26] the future of software development in
[9:28] the AI era, deep dives into Sonar Cube,
[9:31] sessions on integrating code quality
[9:33] into CI/CD pipelines, a lot of awesome
[9:36] events to attend. And by the way, it's
[9:38] free to come to Sonar Summit and they
[9:40] are running this virtual event in pretty
[9:42] much every single time zone. And so if
[9:44] you want to know how to ship quality at
[9:46] speed, not just code at speed, I would
[9:49] highly recommend checking it out and I
[9:50] will have a link in the description. So
[9:52] hopefully the value of agent teams and
[9:55] how to run them is clear to you. Now I
[9:57] want to talk about how they are
[9:58] different from sub aents. And this is a
[10:01] really important distinction because now
[10:03] whenever you want to do parallel work
[10:04] with claude code, you have to make that
[10:07] decision. Should I ask Claude to use sub
[10:09] agents or should I ask Claude to spin up
[10:11] an agent team? And spoiler, there still
[10:14] are a lot of times where you want to use
[10:16] sub agents instead, especially because
[10:18] of a couple of problems with agent teams
[10:20] that I'll talk about that'll lead really
[10:22] nicely into the skill that I have built
[10:24] for you. This makes Claude a lot better
[10:27] at using agent teams. So, I'm really
[10:29] excited to show you this, but first,
[10:31] let's talk about sub aents. So, the
[10:33] primary idea with sub agents is context
[10:36] isolation. We want some way to be able
[10:38] to dish out a request that could take
[10:40] tens or even hundreds of thousands of
[10:42] tokens, but all we need back is a
[10:45] summary. So, our primary agent knows
[10:47] generally what happened, but it doesn't
[10:49] have to be polluted by the context of
[10:51] the entire task. And this is important
[10:54] because context is the most precious
[10:56] resource when you're using an AI coding
[10:59] assistant. But this context isolation
[11:01] has downsides to it because there is no
[11:03] coordination between sub aents and the
[11:05] entire process is just a black box
[11:08] because it is only the summary, the
[11:10] final output that is given back to our
[11:12] primary agent. And so that is why I say
[11:14] that sub aents are generally used for
[11:17] focused tasks usually something like
[11:19] research because all we care about is
[11:21] the result that summary at the end of
[11:24] the research. If we're doing something
[11:26] like coding and we have a sub agent
[11:28] actually write code then we don't have
[11:30] any idea into the process of the sub
[11:33] aent and so the main agent loses a lot
[11:35] of context as to what was actually
[11:37] implemented which is why I say research
[11:39] over implementation. There's no
[11:41] coordination at all. These sub agents
[11:43] work completely in isolation, which does
[11:46] make them very token efficient because
[11:48] they're honed in on a single task and
[11:50] they're only communicating a little bit
[11:52] back to the primary agent. But sometimes
[11:55] you need a lot more than that. Sometimes
[11:57] you need your agents to coordinate with
[11:58] each other, manage a task list together,
[12:01] and that is where agent teams comes in.
[12:04] With agent teams, we still have a
[12:06] primary agent spinning off these
[12:07] subprocesses, but the difference here is
[12:10] they're actually talking to each other.
[12:12] So, they have this shared task list.
[12:14] They're updating each other on their
[12:15] progress, communicating to the main
[12:17] agent as well. And you can instruct
[12:19] Cloud Code in a lot of different ways
[12:21] how this communication actually takes
[12:23] place. We'll talk about that in a little
[12:25] bit. So, we have true peer-to-peer
[12:27] coordination. And this is so powerful
[12:30] for implementation because for example,
[12:32] our back-end agent might change
[12:34] something in an API endpoint where it
[12:36] would have to tell the front-end agent,
[12:37] hey, I changed this API. Make sure you
[12:39] update the front-end component that uses
[12:42] the API as well. And it can actually do
[12:44] that. When we had sub agents in the past
[12:46] doing that kind of implementation, those
[12:48] kinds of things would break all the time
[12:50] because they're not talking to each
[12:51] other. So, they'd step on each other's
[12:53] toes, but not know they're doing so. And
[12:55] so it was up to the main agent after to
[12:57] find all those bugs and fix it. And it
[12:59] was just a complete mess. And so agent
[13:02] teams is a lot better for
[13:03] implementation. But you have to keep in
[13:06] mind that sub agents are a lot more
[13:09] token efficient. It takes a lot of
[13:11] tokens to set up this task list,
[13:14] maintain that collaboration and the
[13:16] communication between the lead agent and
[13:19] all of the other agents in the team. And
[13:21] so this is a really really rough
[13:22] estimate but yeah often times when
[13:24] you're using agent teams it's like two
[13:26] to four times the token usage compared
[13:28] to just using cloud code by itself or
[13:30] using sub aents and so you oftentimes
[13:33] need the collaboration for coding. So
[13:36] generally I would say if you want a
[13:38] really simple rule of thumb right now
[13:40] you should use sub aents for any kind of
[13:42] research like diving into a codebase or
[13:45] searching the web and then you should
[13:46] use agent teams for your actual
[13:48] implementation. And so a lot of times
[13:50] when you're working with a single
[13:52] conversation of cloud code, you might
[13:54] start with sub agent research like
[13:56] analyzing the codebase and then create
[13:58] that task list and spin up the agent
[14:00] team to knock out the plan that you
[14:02] created from the research. So again,
[14:04] it's sub agents for research, feed that
[14:06] into a plan, and then send that plan
[14:09] into an agent team. Now, as powerful as
[14:12] Asian teams are, there are two more
[14:14] issues that I want to talk about with
[14:16] you and then we'll get into the template
[14:18] where I've been starting to address this
[14:20] and experiment with some things to make
[14:22] Asian teams more reliable. So, the first
[14:24] problem that I've encountered as I've
[14:26] done a lot of testing on both Linux and
[14:29] Mac is that a lot of times you have to
[14:31] be very specific with Claude. Like you
[14:34] have to say, create an agent team with
[14:36] four teammates to do this and this and
[14:37] this. If you aren't really specific, it
[14:40] just kind of hallucinates. It'll make
[14:41] weird teams. Sometimes it doesn't
[14:43] understand how to handle the T-Mux
[14:45] terminals. Most of the time it will
[14:47] work. But there's just those odd
[14:49] instances I ran into where it just
[14:50] totally fell flat on its face. And then
[14:53] the other problem that I've encountered
[14:55] is sometimes even with the agents
[14:57] communicating with each other, they
[14:59] can't truly run in parallel. For
[15:01] example, I had it happen once where I
[15:03] had my database and backend agent run at
[15:06] the same time. the database agent
[15:08] defined a bunch of the schema and then
[15:10] by the time it told the backend agent
[15:12] what the schema actually was, the
[15:14] backend agent almost was done with its
[15:16] work. So it created this entire backend
[15:18] based on a completely incorrect schema.
[15:20] So it had to go back and do a lot of
[15:22] work. And so yes, the communication was
[15:24] there for it to fix itself, but it would
[15:27] have been a lot more token efficient if
[15:29] we just did database agent first, then
[15:32] the backend agent. And so I have been
[15:34] working hard through a lot of
[15:35] experimentation to address both of these
[15:37] things with the skill that I of course
[15:39] will have links in the description. This
[15:41] is giving instructions for cloud code on
[15:44] how to more reliably create agent teams
[15:47] and manage the issue of sometimes things
[15:49] can't be totally parallel and being
[15:51] really specific for how to use the
[15:53] terminals and how to create good teams.
[15:57] And so I have this clone locally ready
[15:59] to go to create a brand new project. And
[16:01] by the way, you can use this skill, and
[16:02] I'll show you how to in a little bit, to
[16:04] create brand new projects or features in
[16:07] existing code bases. And so everything
[16:09] is driven from these instructions here,
[16:11] which I'm not going to get too in the
[16:13] weeds with this right now, but
[16:14] essentially all we have to do is give it
[16:16] a plan, something we've created with sub
[16:18] aent research or whatever. Like here's
[16:20] the next feature we want to build. So we
[16:22] give it the plan, and then it'll use
[16:23] these instructions to figure out what's
[16:26] the optimal team to address this plan.
[16:28] Should we create a backend front end and
[16:30] database agent for the team? Like what
[16:32] should it be? Also giving instructions
[16:34] for how to manage the terminals
[16:35] effectively to reduce some of those
[16:37] hallucinations. And then most
[16:38] importantly, I have this process called
[16:41] contract first spawning. So we're not
[16:42] doing everything in parallel. We we're
[16:44] setting the stage up front for some of
[16:47] that work that has to be done before we
[16:49] can just kick off all the agents like
[16:50] here's our database schema for example.
[16:53] Then we send the agents to work in
[16:55] parallel. And this has gotten very
[16:57] reliable results for me versus just
[16:59] telling Claude, "Spin up an Asian team
[17:01] to do XYZ" without any additional
[17:03] instructions. And running this is super
[17:05] easy. So, all you have to do is follow
[17:07] the instructions in the readme. And like
[17:09] I showed earlier, I even have
[17:10] instructions for how to install T-Mux
[17:13] and then enable the experimental
[17:15] feature. Copy this into the skills
[17:17] directory, either global or for your
[17:18] project. And then that'll give you the
[17:20] command. And so you can run /build with
[17:23] agent team. You give it the path to the
[17:25] plan that you've created already and
[17:26] then you can define the number of agents
[17:29] for the team or also let cloud code
[17:31] figure that out based on your plan. So
[17:33] it can be very very dynamic. So I have
[17:35] an example here in my team terminal. I
[17:37] pointed it to a plan for a brand new
[17:39] project. So I'm starting something from
[17:41] scratch and I'm going to have a team of
[17:43] three agents. And so I'll send this in
[17:45] and it'll look very similar to the demo
[17:48] that I showed you earlier for the code
[17:49] review, but this one's a lot more
[17:51] intricate. We're building an entire
[17:53] project. It has to think quite deeply
[17:54] about the agent team that it'll create.
[17:56] And we'll see it spin that up in a
[17:58] little bit here. All right. So, take a
[18:00] look at this. It's a fresh project and
[18:02] it's defined the contract chain. So, we
[18:04] need things to be set up at least partly
[18:07] in the database before we can even go to
[18:09] the back end. And then same thing with
[18:10] backend before we go to the front end.
[18:12] So, it made the decision here. This is
[18:14] all dynamic just based on the
[18:15] instructions I gave it to spawn the
[18:17] database agent first. So, it's the most
[18:19] upstream in the contract chain. So its
[18:21] first job, oh I lost that there. Its
[18:24] first job is to build the database layer
[18:26] and then send me its contract. So it
[18:28] doesn't have to be done done. It just
[18:29] has to send the contract, then it can
[18:31] spin up the backend agent. So we're
[18:33] still going to have some parallel work,
[18:35] but there's a little bit of the
[18:36] groundwork it has to lay first. And
[18:39] there we go. The database agent sent the
[18:41] contract back to the lead agent. So the
[18:44] groundwork was done. The lead agent knew
[18:46] that. And so it started the back-end
[18:47] agent as well. And then I kicked off
[18:50] another request. So the database agent
[18:51] keeps working actually. And so we're
[18:54] seeing this all happen in parallel
[18:56] still, but we had a much smarter flow.
[18:59] And so we'll see the front end start in
[19:01] a bit as well. I'm not going to show
[19:02] this full example here because the point
[19:04] more is to show the intelligence up
[19:06] front. And I really encourage you to try
[19:08] this command for yourself. Just see the
[19:10] consistency for creating these teams
[19:13] based on the plans, managing the
[19:14] terminals. It's so powerful once you
[19:17] have a bit of instruction to claw code
[19:19] for how you specifically want to use
[19:21] agent teams. So, I'd also encourage you
[19:23] to adjust the skill and the command as
[19:25] you're using it. Make it mold to your
[19:27] use case and how you want to work with
[19:29] these teams because there's a lot of
[19:31] customization that you can do for the
[19:33] specific coordination as well. Like I'm
[19:34] doing this contract first approach. You
[19:37] can do whatever your heart desires. So,
[19:39] that my friend is all that I got for you
[19:41] right now on the new agent team feature.
[19:43] Super powerful stuff. Like I said at the
[19:45] start of the video, I really feel like I
[19:47] am peering into the future of agentic
[19:49] development. But like we've talked
[19:50] about, it is far from perfect right now.
[19:52] And so I'll definitely be covering it in
[19:54] the future as anthropic continues to
[19:57] improve it once it's beyond the
[19:58] experimental feature and also once I
[20:01] work on the skill and continue to use
[20:03] agent teams better and better. And so if
[20:06] you appreciate this video and you're
[20:07] looking forward to more things on agent
[20:09] teams and agent coding, I would really
[20:11] appreciate a like and a subscribe. And
[20:13] with that, I will see you in the next
