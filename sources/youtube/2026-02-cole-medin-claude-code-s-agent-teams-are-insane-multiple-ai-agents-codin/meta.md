## Description

Claude just shipped Agent Teams and it changes the game of AI coding. Instead of one agent doing everything sequentially, you can now spin up multiple agents that communicate with each other in real time, share a task list, and coordinate their work.

This is fundamentally different from subagents. Subagents work in isolation and report back. Agent Teams actually talk to each other, divide work intelligently, and you can interact with each agent directly. I'll show you exactly how it works, how to set it up (Windows, Mac, and Linux), and the use cases where it absolutely dominates traditional coding workflows.
