[0:00] What's up engineers? Andy Devdan here.
[0:02] We've got a couple massive releases to
[0:04] cover. Of course, there is the brand new
[0:06] Claude Opus 4.6. It's a fantastic model.
[0:09] What else is there to say? It's beating
[0:10] all the benchmarks. You've already
[0:12] heard, you've already seen this. This is
[0:14] not what I want to focus on here. The
[0:16] real big idea I want to cover with you
[0:18] today is multi- aent orchestration. The
[0:21] game on the field is changing. It's no
[0:24] longer about what the models allow us to
[0:26] do. As of Sonnet 4.5, these models can
[0:29] do much more than you and I give them
[0:31] credit for. Than you and I really know
[0:32] how to unlock. The true constraint of
[0:35] agentic engineering now is twofold. It's
[0:38] the tools we have available and it's you
[0:41] and I. It is our capabilities. It's our
[0:43] ability to prompt engineer and context
[0:45] engineer the outcomes we're looking for
[0:47] and build them into reusable systems to
[0:51] build them into powerful agentic layers
[0:53] that you and I can wield. The true
[0:56] limitation is you and I. So let's take
[0:57] another stab at improving what we can
[1:00] do. Frontends, backends, scripts. It's
[1:03] too simple for these models. So what I
[1:05] have here is eight unique applications
[1:07] that I had claude opus 4.6 create. I
[1:11] touched none of these by the way. These
[1:13] are all oneshotted. I like to use E2B.
[1:15] Use whatever you want. So Asian
[1:16] sandboxes very powerful. But once again,
[1:18] this is not exactly what I want to focus
[1:20] on here. We're going to use Asian
[1:22] sandboxes as a playground to understand
[1:24] and to really dive into two key big
[1:27] ideas. Multi- aent orchestration, multi-
[1:30] aent observability. Once you put these
[1:32] two pieces together, you can do much
[1:34] more with your powerful cloud code opus
[1:37] 4.6 agent.
[1:42] So, first things first, we're going to
[1:43] crack open the terminal. If we create a
[1:45] new cloud code instance on our multi-
[1:47] aent observability, you'll see that we
[1:49] have a new agent joining the session and
[1:51] we have that session start hook
[1:53] captured. We have a rocket and we've
[1:55] officially kicked off a new session. But
[1:57] before we touch our new multi- aent
[1:59] orchestration capabilities, we need to
[2:00] boot up cloud code in a different way.
[2:02] Close this. And you'll see we got that
[2:04] session end event captured here. And
[2:06] instead of opening this up in a classic
[2:08] terminal, we're going to use T-Mox. And
[2:10] so this is going to give us some
[2:11] powerful capabilities. You'll see in a
[2:13] second. The next thing we're going to do
[2:14] is I just want to make this super clear.
[2:16] I'm going to type which and then clio.
[2:18] So you can see this exact command that
[2:20] I'm running. We're going to export the
[2:21] new cloud code experimental agent teams
[2:24] feature. Setting that to one. We're
[2:25] enabling that feature. So now we're
[2:27] running cloud code inside of a team
[2:29] session. You can see we kicked off a
[2:30] brand new agent. And this is where
[2:32] things get interesting. If I type ls,
[2:34] these are the agent sandbox directories
[2:37] that you saw here. We're going to have
[2:39] our agents investigate and break down
[2:41] how we can set up these applications.
[2:43] So, this going to be our first agent
[2:44] team. Build a new agent team for each
[2:46] codebase in this directory. Have an
[2:48] agent summarize and how to set it up.
[2:51] What you're going to see here is really
[2:52] extraordinary. You can see all of our
[2:54] events getting captured. Observability
[2:55] is really important for knowing what you
[2:57] can really do with your tool. You can
[2:59] see here we're going to start streaming
[3:00] in all of our agent events. Make sure
[3:02] that this is stuck to the bottom here.
[3:03] The first thing our agent does is it
[3:06] creates a task list. We covered this in
[3:08] our previous video. What happens next is
[3:11] extraordinary. So we're in T-Mux and so
[3:13] T-Mux has PES. Our agent is now opening
[3:16] up brand new PES for each sub agent that
[3:19] it wants to run. All right. So I'm going
[3:20] to go full screen here so we can really
[3:21] take a look at this. And I'm going to
[3:22] downsize this a little bit so we can see
[3:24] all eight agents that we kicked off
[3:26] here. Okay. So on the left, our primary
[3:28] agent set up the task list, created a
[3:31] team, and then it assigned a task to
[3:33] each member of the team. And you can see
[3:35] our status lines giving us the agent.
[3:37] Looks like we have haiku agents. You can
[3:39] see our context window, and our agents
[3:41] are going to figure out how to run and
[3:43] summarize each codebase, right? And so
[3:45] if we scroll back here in our agent
[3:46] observability, you can see a lot of work
[3:49] happening. Our haiku agents are running
[3:51] all the tools they need to accomplish
[3:53] the work. And we can dial into an
[3:54] individual agent here. If we click this,
[3:56] you can see this is all the tool calls
[3:58] for one of our agents. Looks like this
[3:59] is our primary agent here, right? Open
[4:01] 4.6. You know, you can see here a lot of
[4:04] work is happening here guys, right?60
[4:06] tool calls within just a minute time
[4:08] span. Okay, we are scaling our compute
[4:11] to scaler impact. All right, if we hop
[4:12] back over here, you can see all the
[4:14] pains are gone. Now, what happened? All
[4:15] of our agents finished, right? They
[4:17] finished their work. So, we can go ahead
[4:18] and get out of full screen mode. And
[4:20] it's just our primary agent running now.
[4:22] Uh we can go ahead and get rid of their
[4:23] swim lane here. And this is a really
[4:26] powerful capability of multi- aent
[4:28] orchestration. You want to spin up
[4:30] specialized agents that do one thing
[4:31] extraordinarily well, right? They focus
[4:33] on one task and then they finish. So our
[4:35] primary agent now is just putting
[4:37] together a summary of the work done by
[4:39] the eight agents. And you know, take a
[4:41] look at the context window here. We've
[4:42] only used 31%. So that means that all of
[4:45] our other agents, they explored eight
[4:47] different code bases. And and to be
[4:48] super clear here, guys, um these are not
[4:50] just frontends. These are full stack
[4:52] applications. Okay? Every single one of
[4:54] these are fullstack applications. We can
[4:56] fully interact with these and you know
[4:58] these are fully built out. They were
[5:00] oneshotted by Opus. Very powerful
[5:02] capabilities here. And none of this
[5:04] matters if you can't first trigger these
[5:07] features and prompt your primary agent
[5:09] to control these powerful workflows. And
[5:11] if you have no idea what's going on
[5:13] underneath the hood, right? This is
[5:14] where vibe coders fall apart. They don't
[5:16] actually know what's going on. And so
[5:18] the engineers, the builders, and even
[5:20] the vibe coders that know what's going
[5:22] on underneath the hood can do so much
[5:24] more. This whole idea that uh engineers
[5:27] are going to be replaced by this
[5:28] technology to me is absurd. And it's
[5:31] because engineers are the best
[5:33] positioned to use agentic technology. So
[5:36] you can see here that um if I hit
[5:38] controlB and left bracket, I'm in scroll
[5:41] mode. Now, the annoying thing about
[5:43] T-Max is that it does change the
[5:44] controls a little bit. I'm in control
[5:46] mode and if I just scroll up, you can
[5:48] see we have summaries for every single
[5:50] agent sandbox application that's stored
[5:52] in my local directory. Okay, so you can
[5:55] see here nice summary of all eight and
[5:56] the primary agent knows how to spin them
[5:58] up. Let's push our multi- aent
[6:00] capabilities further.
[6:05] Here's what we're going to do now. So,
[6:06] I'm going to get out of this mode. I'm
[6:07] just going to hit escape. And we're back
[6:08] in our primary window here. Let's go
[6:10] ahead and actually spin up new agent
[6:12] sandbox instances with each one of these
[6:15] applications. All right. And we'll do it
[6:17] in two teams. We'll have a team of four
[6:19] uh mount the first four applications.
[6:21] Right. Because we have eight unique
[6:22] applications here. If we run ls um and
[6:24] then I'll have a team of four doing the
[6:27] last set of applications. Okay. Um let's
[6:29] prompt engineer this properly. All
[6:31] right. We're going to start with the
[6:32] most important piece. Build a new agent
[6:34] team. So we're triggering. Right. These
[6:36] are information dense keywords that tell
[6:38] the agent we want a specific set of
[6:40] tools to execute. All right. And then
[6:41] I'll say using agent sandboxes. So this
[6:44] is my agent sandbox skill and backslash
[6:46] command. This is a special skill that I
[6:49] have to do wacky stuff like this. Use
[6:51] the back slashreboot and mount 1 through
[6:54] 4 in their own agent sandbox. Be sure to
[6:57] set up every agent. So part of my
[7:00] workflow when I'm doing rapid
[7:01] prototyping, what I like to do is just
[7:02] build it all in an agent sandbox like
[7:04] E2B as you saw here, right? This is an
[7:06] agent sandbox. And then what I'll do is
[7:09] if I like one of the versions, I'll copy
[7:10] it down locally. And I have prompts for
[7:12] that, of course. So what we're going to
[7:14] do now is basically rehost these
[7:16] applications with a specialized agent
[7:18] team. So we'll fire this off. And you
[7:20] can see here right away our
[7:21] observability system picked up on that
[7:23] new user prompt submit event. And now
[7:26] things are going to get awesome again.
[7:27] Our agent is going to first run the
[7:30] agent sandbox skill and it's going to
[7:31] run the back slashcomand skill so that
[7:33] it understands what back slash reboot
[7:35] does. And then it's going to actually
[7:36] kick off the reboot for every one of
[7:39] these directories. And so our agent has
[7:41] figured out all of our tooling. It ran
[7:43] our agent sandbox skill. It ran our
[7:45] backslash command skill. And now it's
[7:47] creating that task list again. And so
[7:48] the task list is the centralized hub.
[7:51] This is where everything gets kicked off
[7:53] from. There we go. Okay. So very cool.
[7:55] Now we're kicking off our agent team.
[7:57] You can see we have that new pane. So we
[7:59] have our primary agent kicking off the
[8:01] first agent. And this agent is then
[8:03] going to run that skill. So every single
[8:05] agent has its own context window, right?
[8:07] So they all need to run the skill. They
[8:08] all need to run the setup commands. You
[8:10] can see it's running through the E2B
[8:12] setup process. And these are all Opus
[8:14] 4.6 agents. But you can see here all of
[8:16] our agents are getting kicked off again.
[8:17] And I'll just go ahead and and you know
[8:19] downsize this a little bit and go full
[8:21] screen here so we can get a good picture
[8:23] of what's going on. Right. All four Opus
[8:25] agents are running in parallel. They're
[8:27] each going to reboot the application.
[8:29] You know what we saw here in the
[8:30] beginning? Basically, we're going to
[8:31] recreate these agent sandbox instances
[8:34] with this new multi- aent orchestration
[8:36] tool. And so, if we hop back to our
[8:39] agent observability system once again,
[8:42] you can see tons and tons of work
[8:44] happening. Right? If we dial into one of
[8:46] these swim lanes, we can get a better
[8:48] understanding of the tools and the
[8:50] impact that every agent is creating. And
[8:52] you know really importantly here if we
[8:54] search for our brand new tools you can
[8:57] see we have these new task list tools uh
[8:59] we should see some if we scroll up here
[9:02] you'll see right we have task update and
[9:04] we have task right so this is kicking
[9:06] off the generalized agent and you can
[9:08] see here this is the exact command that
[9:10] was run to kick off a sub agent sub
[9:13] agent that is executing right here and
[9:15] the great part about running this in
[9:16] T-Max is of course the panes we can
[9:19] continue to just zoom out a little bit
[9:20] so you can get a better view Here, every
[9:22] one of our agents has their own context
[9:24] window, their own model, their own
[9:25] session ID, and you can see they all
[9:27] have their own unique name here as well,
[9:29] right? SBX agent, sandbox agent 1 2 3
[9:32] and four, right? So, this is fantastic.
[9:34] So, I'm focused in this individual
[9:36] window here inside of T-Mox, we need to
[9:38] hit controlB and then left to change our
[9:41] cursor position. What I want to do here
[9:42] is get the the names of the other
[9:45] sandboxes that we didn't kick off. So,
[9:46] I'm just going to ask the primary agent
[9:47] because it's actually not doing anything
[9:49] right now. The primary agent is sitting
[9:50] waiting for events to come back. List
[9:52] sandbox directories we didn't kick off.
[9:55] And you can see here sandbox agent
[9:57] number four has completed its setup.
[9:59] It's pinged a command back to our
[10:02] primary orchestrator agent. So what I'm
[10:04] going to do here is while this is
[10:05] running, I'm going to go ahead and open
[10:06] up a new terminal and kick these off.
[10:08] Let's see if I got a clean paste out of
[10:10] that. We're not going to kick this off
[10:11] in our flat window, right? We need T-Mox
[10:13] to get that visualization to get those
[10:15] multiple panes. So I'm going to run
[10:17] T-Mox once again. Then I'll boot up
[10:18] Cloud Code and then I'll effectively run
[10:20] that exact same prompt. Then what I want
[10:22] to do is get the names of those agents
[10:24] that did not run. So I'll copy this. And
[10:26] I'm doing a little bit of correction
[10:28] here on another screen. I'm having
[10:31] trouble copying this. And so I'm just
[10:33] going to ask my agent to do this for me.
[10:34] Uh, copy the four sandbox directories to
[10:38] my clipboard. Should do a PB copy. There
[10:40] we go. And then I'll just paste this. So
[10:43] only post these four. There we go. And
[10:45] I'll kick that off. Now, we're going to
[10:47] get the remaining sandboxes kicked up.
[10:49] And I'm sure you may have noticed this,
[10:52] but if I go into scroll mode here and
[10:54] scroll to the top, I have run out of my
[10:56] API usage for today on my Cloud Max
[10:59] plan. So, I am using API billing and uh
[11:01] yeah, this is going to burn a hole in my
[11:03] wallet. Drop a like, drop a comment, uh
[11:06] so that the YouTube algorithm can can
[11:07] pay for some of this API usage. But I'll
[11:09] hit escape and I'll go ahead and let
[11:11] this second agent start kicking off this
[11:14] workflow. And so, we're going to see the
[11:15] same thing. And if we look at our agent
[11:17] observability, we can see everything. We
[11:20] can understand everything that our
[11:21] agents are doing top to bottom. And if
[11:23] we go ahead and look over here, you can
[11:25] see that we have one more agent
[11:27] finishing up its work. Right? Sandbox
[11:28] agent number two is the last one still
[11:31] in progress. So this is a very powerful
[11:33] feature. We can now observe our agents
[11:35] in a more improved way just with T-Mox,
[11:38] just by seeing these new PES open up as
[11:40] our primary orchestrator agent starts to
[11:43] set up and scale up this work. Then
[11:45] whenever we need to, we can just scale
[11:47] up and create a brand new team. So
[11:49] here's that second team of agents doing
[11:52] a whole different set of work in a brand
[11:55] new window. All right, so you can see
[11:56] that same process. We go full screen. Uh
[11:58] minimize this a little bit so we can get
[12:00] a better view. We have two teams of
[12:02] agents working and we have an
[12:03] observability system to trace the whole
[12:05] thing. And so whenever we want to, we
[12:07] can just come in here. It's got all four
[12:08] agents running. It's going to mount
[12:10] these applications. We're going to
[12:11] create a new E2B agent sandbox, upload
[12:14] the app codebase, install, get
[12:15] everything set up as if it's a brand new
[12:17] environment. So, we're combining several
[12:19] really, really powerful ideas here that
[12:21] we've been talking about on the channel
[12:23] week after week. We have multi- aent
[12:25] observability so we know what's going
[12:26] on, so we know how to improve and
[12:29] understand our systems. We have spaces
[12:31] to place our agents so that they can do
[12:33] whatever they need to to accomplish
[12:35] their work without jeopardizing our
[12:37] local machine. And then of course we
[12:39] have the new multi- aent orchestration
[12:41] capabilities coming out of claw code on
[12:43] top of a brand new ultra powerful model
[12:46] that can run long duration tasks. All
[12:49] right. So we're talking about long
[12:50] threads. We're talking about big threads
[12:53] and we're handing off more and more work
[12:55] to our agents. That is the theme here.
[12:58] How can you prompt engineer and how can
[13:00] you context engineer with great powerful
[13:02] models to get more engineering work done
[13:05] than ever with confidence. All right. We
[13:07] want to be building systems of trust
[13:09] with our agents. Now, scaling up the
[13:11] model is always going to help with this,
[13:13] but this is not something we're really
[13:15] in control of. Whenever the new model
[13:16] ships, whatever it costs, we are just
[13:18] subjects to that. But what we can
[13:20] control is the great tooling we use
[13:22] alongside these three powerful
[13:24] capabilities. And so, that's one of the
[13:26] big ideas I wanted to share with you
[13:27] here today. Multi-agent orchestration,
[13:29] multi- aent observability, so you can
[13:31] dial in to anything your agents are
[13:33] doing. And then of course we have agent
[13:35] sandboxes, a secure location to place
[13:38] whatever you want to have your agents do
[13:40] at scale. All right. And so we have two
[13:43] teams of four. To be clear, the agents
[13:45] are running on my device, but the work
[13:46] they're doing is operating off the
[13:48] device. They're using their local agent
[13:51] capabilities, their local skills, and
[13:53] then they are creating and operating
[13:54] inside their own agent sandboxes. Okay.
[13:57] So our first team is all set up. And if
[13:59] we go into scroll mode here, Ctrl +B
[14:01] left bracket, and we do some scrolling,
[14:03] we should be able to see everything set
[14:05] up live. So, let's go ahead and open
[14:07] these up. I'll take these existing
[14:09] windows, these existing sandboxes. I'll
[14:11] just move them up onto my monitor here.
[14:14] And then we should see them open up in
[14:15] this browser window here. We'll take a
[14:17] look at the the brand new tools that
[14:19] allow and enable these workflows in just
[14:21] a second. Let's go ahead and just get
[14:22] these opened up so we can see how our
[14:24] agents have done. I'll say open in
[14:26] Chrome. You can see these sandboxes are
[14:28] going to be alive for 12 hours. All
[14:30] right. And it looks like they did open
[14:31] up in this other window. Super annoying.
[14:33] That's fine. I will copy these four
[14:35] newest ones. Drag them in. Here we go.
[14:38] So, here's our agentic support. It looks
[14:40] like we're missing some data here. And
[14:42] looks like we're missing data here.
[14:44] Let's see if we got our gallery. Nice.
[14:46] Okay. So, we did get some nice
[14:47] information there. And we have our data
[14:49] here. All right. So, very cool. And so,
[14:51] we can continue to prompt to resolve
[14:52] these issues. I'm going to go ahead and
[14:53] just give this a shot. And I'll say data
[14:55] is missing from this. And let's go ahead
[14:59] and go here as well. Basically, our
[15:01] sandboxes were rebooted, but it didn't
[15:04] reboot with the exact same data or with
[15:06] any data for those two applications. So,
[15:08] we're going to go ahead and have these
[15:09] agents do this work. And what I'll do
[15:11] here is I'm going to stop this cuz the
[15:12] primary agent started working, right?
[15:14] You saw that the primary agent is trying
[15:16] to take over. I'll say spin up a new
[15:18] agent team to do this work for you. Give
[15:20] them all the context they need. skills
[15:23] sandbox back/command. And so I'm just
[15:24] being super verbose there with my prompt
[15:26] engineering with that agent. You can see
[15:28] here our second team finished. So let's
[15:30] see how this team did. Yeah, open all
[15:32] four URLs in Chrome. Okay, so we'll kick
[15:34] these off. All right, so we have these
[15:35] opened up. Let's go ahead and get these
[15:37] drag and dropped over here. Okay, we
[15:40] have our mission briefings dashboard. We
[15:42] have our portfolio application, so we
[15:45] can track our forecast for our
[15:47] portfolio. We have a recipe app and we
[15:50] have a ad dashboard to see how our ads
[15:53] are performing. Nice. So we got all the
[15:55] data for these. So all of these four
[15:56] worked. Love to see that. And the two
[15:58] issues we had with these code bases are
[16:00] getting resolved here with our two agent
[16:02] agent team. So this is an iterative
[16:05] process as well. We're going to want to
[16:06] be firing off ad hoc agent teams to
[16:09] perform specific sets of work. In our
[16:11] previous video where we talked about the
[16:13] task list feature, let me go ahead and
[16:15] see if I have that diagram pulled up
[16:17] here. Yeah. So in our previous video we
[16:18] talked about the cloud code task system
[16:20] where you prompt your primary agent and
[16:22] your primary agent creates a task list
[16:24] that multiple agents basically an agent
[16:26] team operates on. This is a very
[16:28] powerful feature that is taken to the
[16:30] next step with the multi- aent
[16:32] orchestration feature that you can now
[16:33] tap into. All right, but the idea here
[16:35] is really really important as you're
[16:36] building out real features as you're
[16:38] scaling up the work you can do with your
[16:39] agents. It's not just about a single
[16:42] agent or even a couple agents or even
[16:44] parallel agents. You want to be building
[16:45] teams that communicate together that are
[16:48] all driven toward accomplishing one
[16:50] specific goal, right? Think about
[16:52] building out a feature. That's way too
[16:54] much work, especially as you enter real
[16:56] legitimate production code bases.
[16:58] Building out a full feature requires
[17:01] organization. It requires communication,
[17:03] right? And so this new agent
[17:05] orchestration feature allows us to
[17:07] really tap into that brand new system,
[17:10] that way of thinking. All right? And and
[17:12] this is what this feature looks like end
[17:13] to end. We're going to create a team.
[17:14] We're going to uh create tasks. We're
[17:17] spawn agents. They all work in parallel
[17:18] and then they shut down and then we
[17:20] delete the team. And we'll look at the
[17:22] tools here in just a second. But a
[17:23] really important aspect of this is that
[17:24] when the work is done, you want to
[17:26] delete the agents. This forces a good
[17:28] pattern of context engineering where you
[17:30] reset the context and start over. So you
[17:33] can see here's the agent shutdown
[17:34] process happening from our primary
[17:36] agent. These are shutting down. The
[17:37] tasks are gone. The pains are now gone.
[17:40] And so apparently this has fixed the
[17:42] issue. You can see here DB was intact.
[17:44] We restarted. Uh both processes were
[17:46] down. So we should be good on these two
[17:48] uh applications. Let's refresh. Still
[17:50] not good there. That's too bad. And
[17:52] let's refresh here. It looks like this
[17:53] one did load its data here. Let me see
[17:56] if that actually worked. Loading pull
[17:57] requests. And still nothing here. All
[17:59] right. So we have issues here. I don't
[18:01] really care about these. You get the
[18:02] point here, right? We got six out of
[18:03] eight sandbox environments spun up in
[18:06] brand new systems. And you know, just to
[18:08] be super clear and transparent. Here are
[18:09] the new environments and the new URLs.
[18:12] Here are the old ones. I just want to
[18:13] show that I have these and that these
[18:15] are actually different URLs. All right,
[18:16] so these are all unique Asian sandboxes.
[18:18] And we can be even clear about this. I
[18:20] have a bunch of these running right now.
[18:22] If I go to a terminal here and I say um
[18:25] I pass in this skill, we should spin up
[18:27] a new agent for this. We always want to
[18:29] be operating on fresh instances. We
[18:30] don't need T-Max for this. This is going
[18:32] to be a single cloud code instance. And
[18:33] I just want to show you all the current
[18:35] running agent sandboxes. So I'll kick
[18:37] this off. I'll fire off my agent sandbox
[18:39] skill. And I'll just say list all
[18:40] running sandboxes. And so we should see
[18:43] I don't know some 20 or 30 sandboxes
[18:45] here. You can see it's validating my ETB
[18:47] key. And then um let's go ahead and see.
[18:50] There we go. Working through some
[18:52] issues. It of course has a sandbox list.
[18:54] You can see we have 24 sandboxes. Let's
[18:56] go ahead and get that list just to make
[18:57] it super clear here how much compute
[19:00] we're running in parallel. There we go.
[19:02] Looks like that was the command. It's
[19:04] getting the information for each sandbox
[19:06] environment. I'll link a previous video
[19:08] where we talked about how you can set
[19:10] this up and how this really works in the
[19:12] description for you if you're
[19:13] interested. I think agent sandboxes are
[19:15] and will be a big big big trend as we
[19:18] scale up what our agents can do on our
[19:20] behalf. You're seeing this with the
[19:22] whole Mac Mini craze. As you can see in
[19:24] the background, um I have a Mac Mini.
[19:26] I've had this thing for a while and was,
[19:27] you know, a decent amount ahead of that
[19:29] trend, having my agents run in its own
[19:31] dedicated environment. As you can
[19:32] imagine, I have multiple sandbox
[19:34] environments. One like E2B operating
[19:36] purely in the cloud. And then for more
[19:38] personal workflow where, you know,
[19:40] privacy is important. You can have
[19:42] agents run of course on your own local
[19:44] devices like everyone is doing with
[19:46] Maltbot or Cloudbot or whatever it's
[19:48] called now. But you can see here, you
[19:49] know, I have 24 agent sandboxes running.
[19:52] And you know, you can see I have
[19:54] duplicates of a lot of these things that
[19:55] we've been looking at here, right? So I
[19:57] have multiple versions of this. Just
[19:58] wanted to make this super clear. I have
[19:59] a skill. I have an agent that operates
[20:01] and can manage all of these agent
[20:03] sandboxes at scale. This is going to be
[20:05] really important moving forward when
[20:07] you're scaling your compute to scale
[20:08] your impact, which is the big theme of
[20:10] everything we're looking at right now.
[20:11] All right. Here we looked at how to spin
[20:13] up teams of agents. Okay. And it all
[20:16] comes back to things we talk about on
[20:18] the channel all the time. all these
[20:20] fantastic new tools coming out of the
[20:22] cloud code team, all these new
[20:23] capabilities. There is a lot of
[20:25] engineering work they put into this. You
[20:26] know, big shout out to the cloud code
[20:28] team. But I do want to say that
[20:29] underneath all of it is a concept we
[20:32] always discuss. It's the core for
[20:34] context model prompt tools. Everything
[20:37] boils down to that. All right,
[20:38] everything is the core four. Okay, and
[20:41] just quickly, you know, we saw all of
[20:43] this work happen. We saw our multi- aent
[20:46] system track all of this. And you can
[20:48] see all these new task tools. Team
[20:50] delete, team create. We have these new
[20:51] task tools. Task create, task get. So
[20:54] what are all the new available tools?
[20:56] Let's go and take a look at this. We
[20:58] have kind of three categories of tools
[21:00] that this, you know, new multi- aent
[21:01] orchestration system gives us. Team
[21:04] management, task management, and
[21:05] communications. Team create, task, team
[21:08] delete. Task has been around for a long
[21:10] time. This is how you kick off an agent
[21:12] in parallel. But then we have all the
[21:13] new task management tools, right? task
[21:16] create, task list, task get, task
[21:17] update. But the most important one of
[21:19] all probably is this send message. This
[21:21] is how the agents were communicating and
[21:23] after they communicate, after they do
[21:24] all the work as we described here in
[21:26] this workflow, right? This is kind of
[21:28] the multi- aent orchestration workflow
[21:30] built out with this new tool. It's it's
[21:31] this, right? Create the team, create the
[21:33] tasks, spawn the agents, work in
[21:35] parallel, shut them all down, delete the
[21:37] team. This is the full workflow of the
[21:40] brand new Claw multi- aent capabilities.
[21:42] So with every new capability, with every
[21:45] new feature coming out of cloud code,
[21:48] coming out of all these agentic coding
[21:50] tools, with every new release of the new
[21:52] model, the question is always the same
[21:55] for you and I, the engineer with our
[21:57] boots on the ground working with the
[21:59] technology every single day. How can we
[22:01] understand the capabilities available to
[22:03] us to accelerate our engineering work?
[22:06] models will improve, tools will change,
[22:09] and that means that you and I will
[22:11] always be the limitation. It's about
[22:13] what you and I can do. So, with every
[22:15] feature release, make sure you're
[22:16] digging in. Make sure you're
[22:18] understanding what's available to you so
[22:20] that you know what you can do. Every
[22:22] engineer is limited by their tools and
[22:24] their knowledge of their tool. So,
[22:26] that's why multi- aent observability is
[22:28] super key. Throughout any point in this
[22:30] workflow, we can jump in here and we can
[22:32] investigate and see the communication,
[22:35] see the tasks between our agents that we
[22:38] kicked off. We can see all the events.
[22:40] I'm going to leave my multi- aent
[22:41] observability updated to support all
[22:44] these new tools. Link in the description
[22:45] for you. And I'll also link a previous
[22:48] video and my agent sandbox skill for you
[22:51] to play with. Again, link in the
[22:53] description for you. If you're
[22:54] interested in taking your agentic coding
[22:56] to the next level, check out tactical
[22:58] agentic coding. This is my take on how
[23:01] you can accelerate far past AI coding
[23:04] and vibe coding with advanced agentic
[23:06] engineering. So powerful your codebase
[23:09] runs itself. We're seeing multi- aent
[23:11] orchestration come out of the cloud code
[23:13] team. We have had this documented and
[23:16] covered inside of this course inside of
[23:17] agentic horizon specifically. We have
[23:20] had working versions of multi- aent
[23:22] orchestration for months now. This is
[23:24] all here. You know, a lot of the ideas
[23:26] we talk about on the channel are taken
[23:28] to the next level inside this course. If
[23:29] you're interested, check this out. I
[23:30] know a lot of engineers on the channel
[23:32] have already checked out this course.
[23:33] And you know, to be super clear, there
[23:35] are thousands of engineers that have
[23:36] taken this and that have gotten great
[23:38] value out of this. So, I'll leave this
[23:39] linked in the description if you're
[23:41] interested as well. We're going to be
[23:42] covering multi-agent orchestration a lot
[23:44] as we move forward. It's going to be a
[23:46] big trend because it allows us to do
[23:48] what we always do on this channel. Scale
[23:51] our compute to scale our impact. Thanks
[23:54] so much for sticking around. You know
[23:55] where to find me every single Monday.
[23:58] Stay focused and keep building.
