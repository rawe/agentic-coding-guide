## Description

🔥 The ENGINEERING game on the field is CHANGING. It's no longer about what the models can do — it's about YOU and your ability to orchestrate them.

Multi-Agent Orchestration is HERE and if you're not scaling your compute, you're leaving engineering power on the table.

🚀 In this video, IndyDevDan breaks down the brand-new Claude Code multi-agent orchestration capabilities powered by Opus 4.6. We go beyond the benchmarks and dive straight into what matters: how to spin up Claude Teams of specialized agents that work in parallel, each with their own context window, their own model, and their own tasks. Watch as we orchestrate two full teams of four Opus agents running simultaneously across eight full-stack applications using Tmux, E2B agent sandboxes, and the new Claude Code experimental agent teams feature.

🛠️ This is tactical agentic coding at its finest. We demonstrate how to prompt engineer your primary agent to create task lists, spawn sub-agents, assign work, and coordinate results — all within a single orchestration workflow. From team creation to task assignment to parallel execution to shutdown, you'll see the complete Claude Code Orchestration lifecycle in action. The new tools — TeamCreate, TeamDelete, TaskCreate, TaskList, TaskGet, TaskUpdate, and SendMessage — give you full control over agent orchestration like never before.

🔍 But orchestration without visibility is chaos. That's why we pair multi-agent orchestration with multi-agent observability. Using our open-source observability system, you can trace every tool call, every agent session, and every task update across your entire agent fleet. We tracked 160+ tool calls in under a minute and maintained full visibility into what each agent was doing. This is how engineers build systems of trust with their agents.

💡 The core lesson: everything comes back to the core four — context, model, prompt, tools. Opus 4.6 gives you the model. Claude Code Orchestration gives you the tools. Agent sandboxes give you the space. But the true constraint is YOU — your ability to context engineer and prompt engineer the outcomes you need. Vibe coders fall apart here. Engineers thrive.

🌟 Whether you're scaling agentic coding workflows, building agent observability pipelines, or exploring agent orchestration patterns, this video gives you the playbook. Scale your compute to scale your impact.

Stay focused and Keep Building.
